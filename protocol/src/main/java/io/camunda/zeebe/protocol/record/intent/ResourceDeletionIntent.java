/**
 * Given resource exists on partitions 1 and 2 First we receive a DELETE command on partition 1
 * (default distro partition) Then, we need to keep track that deletion has started on partition 1
 * and partition 1 must know that partition 2 has not yet deleted it
 * (DeploymentDistribution.DELETING event) Then, we can send a delete request to partition 2 we sent
 * it by sending a SBE message from partition 1 to partition 2 partition 2's sbe handler then writes
 * a command (ResourceDeletionIntent.DISTRIBUTE) on its logstream Then, partition 1 writes
 * DeploymentDistribution.DISTRIBUTING for partition 2
 *
 * <p>On partition 2 we receive the delete request (ResourceDeletionIntent.DISTRIBUTE) THEN,
 * partition 2 deletes the deployment by writing ResourceDeletionIntent.DISTRIBUTED event (applier
 * results in removing the deployment)
 *
 * <p>After deleting the deployment on partition 2, it acks it by sending a request to partition 1
 * (DeploymentDistribution.COMPLETE command for partition 2)
 *
 * <p>partition 1 (DeploymentDistribution.COMPLETE command) processing results in
 * DeploymentDistribution.COMPLETED (removing the pending state)
 *
 * <p>// do we want to wait with deleting the resource from partition 1 until all have acknowledged
 * deletion, or do we do it as soon as possible. We should do it ASAP, to avoid that an unhealthy
 * partition blocks deletion from others Finally, we can delete the resource from partition 1
 * (ResourceDeletionIntent.DISTRIBUTED)
 *
 * <p>distribution is done with DISTRUBTE, DISTRIBUTING, FULLY_DISTRIBUTED
